# Initial Read Me (Needs updating)

This is the first draft of the Task Slayer project - a command line adventure game to put your tasks and convert them to quests in a rolling dice like game to earn gold, honor, and glory.

To initialize - install the required libraries through requirements.txt:
```python 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To Start the game:
```python
python roll.py
```
You will need to update tickets.xlsx with the information in the spreadsheet currently there is just sample data - TODO is  to make this better to not read from a spreadsheet, dynamically pull from a connected source - Google Tasks, Listmoz, Trello, Jira, custom open to suggestions
